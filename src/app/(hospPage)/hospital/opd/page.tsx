            Kayachikitsa is an important branch amongst eight branches of
            Ayurveda, dealing with multi-systemic illnesses. The holistic
            approach in consideration of Prakriti (Body Constitution), Saara
            (Tissue Essence), Satwa (Mental health), etc., Asthasthana (Nadi
            Pareeksha, etc.), Dashavidha diagnostic’s tools and therapeutics
            with various medicaments (Detoxifying & Palliative) is the
            uniqueness of this specialty. A unique aspect of Kaya Chikitsa is
            Kaya Kalpa. Kaya Kalpa refers to the renewal and rejuvenation of the
            body. It sustains the youthfulness of the body and slows down the
            effects of aging through the application of physical and
            psychological methods to the body once it has been detoxified
            through Panchakarma.

            Panchkarma— panch and karmas, when literally translated means ‘Five
            Procedures’. It is an ayurvedic treatment that involves elaborated
            methods of purification to release stress, which prepares the body
            tissues to accept the maximum benefits of food, nutrition and
            exercise.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The five procedures are Vamana (Emesis), Virechana (Purgation),
            Niroohavasti (Decoction enema), Nasya (Instillation of medicine
            through nostrils), and Anuvasanavasti (Oil enema). Panchkarma
            treatment is a three stage process—purva (pre-operative), pradhana
            (operative) and paschat (post-operative) measures. Ayurveda advises
            to practice Purvakarma because of the deep rooted imbalances in the
            body, which needs to be flushed out in the right way by Purvakarma.

            To undergo a purification therapy it is highly important for the
            body to be prepared for the rigorous process to encourage the body
            to let go of the toxins. Treatments like abhyangam, shirodhara and
            elakizhi are included to soften the tissues where the oil is applied
            to the entire body with a particular type of massage which helps the
            toxins to move towards the gastro- intestinal tract. Thereafter,
            therapies like Vamana, Virechana, Vasti, Nasya, Raktamoksha are used
            as per the body constitution (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) to complete the
            detoxifying process.
