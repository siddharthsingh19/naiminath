        <h2>The Essence of Spine Basti</h2>
        Spine Basti, derived from the Sanskrit word “Basti” meaning to retain or hold, is a therapeutic Ayurvedic procedure focused on the spine. It involves creating a dam-like structure over the spinal area using dough made from medicinal grains. Warm, herbalized oil is then poured within this structure, allowing the oil to be absorbed by the tissues around the spine. This treatment aims to nourish and revitalize the spinal column, addressing a wide range of spinal issues and promoting overall wellness.
