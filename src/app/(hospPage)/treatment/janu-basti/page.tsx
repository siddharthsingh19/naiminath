      <h2>Janu Basti: Nurturing Knee Health</h2>
      Janu Basti is an Ayurvedic therapy designed to alleviate knee pain,
      promote flexibility, and enhance joint mobility. The treatment involves
      creating a reservoir of medicated oil over the knee joint, allowing the
      warm herbal oil to penetrate deeply into the tissues. This therapeutic
      practice is ideal for individuals seeking holistic knee care and
      rejuvenation.
      <h2>How Janu Basti can be profoundly helpful</h2>

      specialized treatment, available at Naiminath Ayurvedic Medical College,
      Hospital &amp; Research Center (NAMC) in Agra, is designed to address the
      root causes of knee discomfort and enhance overall well-being. Here’s how

          </h3>
          Individuals with stiff knees often experience limited joint mobility.

              Supporting Knee Functionality:
            </span>
          </h3>
          By nourishing the knee joint’s tissues and structures, Janu Basti aids
          in maintaining optimal knee functionality. The treatment supports the
          joint’s ability to bear weight, bend, and move comfortably.
