    <h2>The Essence of Kizhi</h2>
    Kizhi, a therapeutic technique from Ayurveda, involves the application of warm
    herbal poultices to the body. These poultices, known as “Kizhi,” are filled
    with a mixture of healing herbs, medicinal leaves, and other natural
    ingredients. The Kizhi massage bundles are gently pressed on the body’s
    specific points, promoting relaxation, reducing pain, and revitalizing the
    energy pathways. This treatment is particularly effective in addressing
    musculoskeletal issues, joint pain, and promoting overall wellness.

        Proper blood circulation is vital for healing. Kizhi’s application creates
        a gentle pressure on the skin, enhancing circulation and ensuring that
        oxygen and nutrients reach all parts of the body. Detoxification: The heat
        from Kizhi helps open up the skin’s pores, facilitating the release of
        toxins through sweat. This detoxification process rejuvenates the body,
        promoting overall vitality.
